 I believe that coding is a skill that people should have because it teaches critical thinking. I am not quite yet an expert but I work hard to learn more everyday. These skills are more relevant to getting a job then those taught at most job training programs.

Those programs are outdated, no longer serving their purpose, but rather a way for people to keep their jobs. I can understand that, but people really do need jobs. Its a myth that people like living in poverty and love welfare. It is also a myth that people do not want to work. There are bad apples in every class of society, its just the further up the ladder, the better the lawyer.

Learning to code not only teaches them to think, provide a new job skill, but allows them to work from home or anywhere there is internet access, thus alleviating them of the transportation problem that is said to be a major issue.
Like I said, I am not great at coding. I am the type of guy that is pushing myself to build my own page despite all of the WYSIWYG editors and Wordpress, because I love new challenges. I will be a cyberjedi , I will be a cipher, and what better way to improve my skills then by building a program or creating some exercises to help others.

I am no angel or a bleeding heart but I am sick of the continued arguing as a national discussion instead of actually talking about solutions. I don't think everyone has to get along, but everyone should want to do whats best for our country. Like it or not, she's all we got.

I look forward to any ideas or contributions you might have for this project because I think this is very important. It needs to be done. Thanks.
